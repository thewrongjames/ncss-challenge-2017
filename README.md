# ncss-challenge-2017
Various python programs used to answer the challenges in the 2017
NCSS challenge (advanced and intermediate). All of advanced should be in here,
with the only one I didn't finish being the degree distribution one, which was
because I left it too late. Much, but not all, of the intermediate is also
here.
